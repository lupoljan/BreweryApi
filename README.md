This is a sample enterprise-style API built with **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQLite**.

- **AutoMapper** for DTO <-> Entity mapping
- **Dependency Injection** throughout services and repositories
- **Sorting** strategies (Name, City, Distance ‚Äì via Strategy Pattern)
- **Search + Autocomplete** functionality
- **Caching** results for 10 minutes
- **Global Exception Handling** with error code mapping
- **Logging** (built-in + custom middleware)
